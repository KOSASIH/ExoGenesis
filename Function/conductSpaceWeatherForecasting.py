    model = RandomForestRegressorThe updated function code for conductSpaceWeatherForecasting() now includes the necessary imports at the beginning of the function. The function has been updated to handle the case where the forecast horizon is greater than the number of available hours in the training data. In this case, the function will forecast solar flux for the next 24 hours. The forecast dates are generated using the pd.date_range() function, and the last date is excluded from the forecast dates to avoid forecasting for the same date as the last training data.

Here is the updated function code for conductSpaceWeatherForecasting():

To handle this case, you can use a different approach called "temporal cross-validation". This involves splitting your data into a training set and a testing set, but instead of using a fixed split, you use a rolling window that moves through your data. This way, you can use all of your available data for training, and still have a testing set to evaluate your model's performance.
