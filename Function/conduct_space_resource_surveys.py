    Conduct space resource surveys to assess resource abundance, distribution, and accessibility within the space-based infrastructure.

    Parameters:
    infrastructure_graph (networkx.Graph): A directed graph representing the space-based infrastructure, where nodes represent
    components and edges represent communication links.
    celestial_bodies (list): A list of celestial bodies within the space-based infrastructure.
